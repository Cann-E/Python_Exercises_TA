# 1. Create a List
# Create a list called `fruits` containing the names of 5 different fruits.
# Print the list.

# 2. Access List Elements
# From the `fruits` list, print the first fruit and the last fruit using indexing.

# 3. Modify List Elements
# Change the second fruit in the `fruits` list to "Mango".
# Print the updated list.

# 4. Add and Remove Elements
# Add "Pineapple" to the `fruits` list.
# Remove the first fruit from the list.
# Print the updated list.

# 5. List Length
# Write a function `list_length(lst)` that takes a list as input
# and returns the number of elements in the list.
# Test it with the `fruits` list.

# 6. Check If Element Exists
# Write a function `check_element(lst, element)` that takes a list and an element.
# Return True if the element exists in the list, otherwise return False.
# Test it with the `fruits` list and the element "Mango".

# 7. Iterate Over a List
# Write a function `print_list(lst)` that takes a list as input and prints each element
# on a separate line. Test it with the `fruits` list.

# 8. Sort a List
# Write a function `sort_list(lst)` that sorts a list in ascending order.
# Test it with a list of numbers: [5, 3, 8, 1, 4].

# 9. Find the Largest Number
# Write a function `find_largest(lst)` that takes a list of numbers
# and returns the largest number in the list.
# Test it with a list of numbers: [12, 45, 7, 29, 30].

# 10. Combine Two Lists
# Write a function `combine_lists(lst1, lst2)` that takes two lists and
# returns a new list containing all elements from both lists.
# Test it with the lists: [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6].
